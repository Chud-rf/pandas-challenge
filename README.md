Written Report:

During my analysis I found the data to be very interesting. Looking at the percentage of overall students to pass, the top 5 schools are all charter schools and the bottom 5 are all district. Although, the charter schools have a lower amount of total students. 

When looking at the spending summary of the analysis there seems to be another correlation. The spending ranges show that higher spending per student leads to a decrease in passing percentage. Another interesting point is the school size. Small to medium sized school show better performance than the large schools. 


Two conclusions I would draw from this analysis is:
- Charter schools prove to have a better overall success rate of students passing.
- Higher spending per student does not increase overall success rate. It actually negatively affects it.
